# Radio Player Page

Radio Player Page is a WordPress plugin that provides **dedicated, standalone player pages** for your radio streams. Each station gets its own page with program scheduling and continuous playback, without depending on your theme.

## Features

- **Standalone player pages** — One URL per station; the plugin serves a minimal HTML page so theme scripts and styles never interfere with playback.
- **Program schedule** — Weekly lineup with named programs and optional logos. The player shows the current and next program and announces the upcoming show when it starts in 10 minutes or less. All times use your WordPress timezone.
- **Stream compatibility** — Works with Icecast, Shoutcast, HLS (.m3u8), DASH (.mpd), and MP3. The plugin detects the format and uses the right player; iOS Safari uses native HLS.
- **Multiple stations** — Up to 10 stations per installation, each with its own streaming URL, WordPress page, branding, and optional schedule.
- **Visual customization** — Eight color themes and four real-time audio visualizers (Oscilloscope, Bars Spectrum, Amplitude Waterfall, Spectral Particles). Station logo and background image per station.
- **Sleep timer** — Stop playback automatically after 30, 60, or 120 minutes; countdown is visible and the timer cancels if you pause.
- **Timezone clock** — When the station timezone differs from the listener’s, a clock shows the station’s local time and the offset.
- **Media Session API** — Station name and artwork on device lock screens and system media controls.
- **Multilingual player** — Player UI in English (US), Spanish, Spanish (Mexico), Russian, Dutch, Romanian, Swedish, Galician, and Danish; language is detected from the browser.
