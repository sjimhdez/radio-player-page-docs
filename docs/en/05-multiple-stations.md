# Multiple Stations

Radio Player Page supports up to **10 stations** in a single WordPress installation. Each station has its own streaming URL, WordPress page, and optional branding and program schedule.

## Per-station settings

Each station is independent:

- **Streaming URL** and **Player Page** — Every station must have its own URL and its own page; a page can be assigned to only one station.
- **Station Name**, **Logo Image**, **Background Image**, **Theme Color**, **Visualizer** — All optional and specific to that station.
- **Program Schedule** — Optional and separate per station. One station can have a full weekly schedule while another has none.

## Managing stations

- **Add Station** — When you have fewer than 10 stations, an **Add Station** button is shown. Click it to reveal a new station block with the same fields. Fill in at least **Streaming URL** and **Player Page** and click **Save Changes**.
- **Remove Station** — Each station except the first (Station 1) has a **Remove Station** link. Use it to delete that station’s configuration. Station 1 cannot be removed; you can clear its URL and page if you no longer use it.
- **Empty stations** — Stations with neither a streaming URL nor a player page selected are not saved; the plugin only stores stations that have both.

## Use cases

- **Radio networks** — Several stations (e.g. different cities or formats) from one WordPress site, each with its own URL and branding.
- **Multiple channels** — For example, one stream for music and another for news or talk, each on its own page.
- **Multiple streams** — Any setup where you need more than one player page with different streams and optional schedules.
